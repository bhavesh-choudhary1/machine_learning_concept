# Machine Learning Practice ‚Äì Preprocessing & EDA

Hey there! üëã

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks I‚Äôve been working on as I dive deeper into Machine Learning. The focus so far has been on understanding and implementing core concepts like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). These are the foundational steps before model building, and getting them right makes a huge difference.

All notebooks are created using Google Colab, and I‚Äôve kept them modular ‚Äî each one focuses on a specific topic or technique.

## ‚úçÔ∏è About This Repo

This is a personal learning space ‚Äî everything here is written and practiced by me to get a deeper, hands-on understanding of the core ML pipeline. Each notebook is commented and structured to make revisiting topics easier as I progress further into more advanced ML concepts.
